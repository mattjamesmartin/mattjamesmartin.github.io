    "text": "My name is Matthew Martin (he/him), and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. My fields of study are public law and comparative politics. My research interests include public participation in constitution-making, authoritarian constitutions, Latin American politics, and immigration law and politics. I am in the early stages of my dissertation, which examines the use of public consultation in constitution-making.\nPrior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in Political Science and Legal Studies from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law at a firm in Washington, D.C. I assisted attorneys with family- and humanitarian- based immigration cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum. Today I continue to support trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers, gathering them legal resources, contacting lawyers, and organizing fundraisers to ensure their security.\nMy current research agenda focuses on public consultations in constitution-making. I am now constructing an original data set of all public consultations in constitution-making since 1789, which I plan to use for my dissertation and future research. I have also been involved in a project at the Comparative Constitutions Project that develops an innovative method for analyzing public consultation records with natural language processing (NLP) tools."
