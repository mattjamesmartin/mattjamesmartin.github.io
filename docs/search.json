My fields of study are public law and comparative politics. My substantive research interests include public participation in constitution-making, Latin American politics, indigenous constitutionalism, and immigration politics. I am currently working on my dissertation, which examines the use of public consultation in constitution-making across the globe.\nPrior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in Political Science and Legal Studies from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law at a firm in Washington, D.C. I assisted attorneys with family- and humanitarian- based immigration cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum. Today I continue to support trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers, gathering legal resources, contacting lawyers, and organizing fundraisers to ensure their security.\nMy research agenda focuses on public consultations in constitution-making. I am constructing an original data set of all such public consultations since 1974. I am also a Senior Research Analyst at the Comparative Constitutions Project working on related topics. We recently developed a new method for analyzing public consultation data using natural language processing (NLP) tools, and our research program continues to grow."

    "title": "Immigration Courts and Abolition",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On May 8, 2021, The New York Times Editorial Board published an article, which boldly stated: “Immigration courts aren’t real courts. It’s time to change that.” The decision to run the piece was surprising considering how little attention the immigration court system typically receives, but by all measures, their diagnosis was accurate. Immigration courts are suffering the largest backlog of pending cases in their history, 1.3 million as of May 2021 according to TRAC. Immigration judges (IJs) lack any meaningful judicial independence—by any definition of the concept—facing perverse work incentives, limited resources, and politicized hiring procedures. And perhaps most glaringly, the chief prosecutor in immigration court is also the chief judge. The U.S. Attorney General has the power to intervene directly in IJ decision-making and overturn decisions they conclude are incorrect, a move employed frequently by former AG Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III.\nWhile these facts are indisputable and the pain of legal limbo for immigrants undeniable, the solution proposed by NYT misses the mark. The answer that the Editorial Board offers is one that immigration advocates have heard many times before—the establishment of an Article I immigration tribunal, or a “legislative court.” Currently, the immigration court system is housed within the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is a sub-agency of the Department of Justice and part of the reason why IJs face so much interference. The idea is to replace the EOIR with an ‘independent’ immigration court system consisting of Article I trial and appellate-level immigration tribunals—what proponents call ‘real’ courts. But this apparent solution is not new (similar proposals date back to at least the W. Bush years), nor is it adequate to address the underlying problem: a heinous deportation machine. We should not be focused on reifying the U.S. immigration bureaucracy, which upends lives and separates families, but on finding ways to keep as many immigrants from getting entangled in this system in the first place\nIn her [work](https://thenewinquiry.com/summer-heat/), well-known activist, educator, and abolitionist Mariame Kaba has underscored the importance of rejecting all talk about policing and the so-called criminal justice system being “broken.” The same principle must be applied to our discussions of the immigration system, which shares the same carceral violence and logics of social control as its criminal counterpart. By constructing the immigration court system, as well as the immigration system in its entirety, as “broken” or “not working,” this rhetorical choice reaffirms reform, rather than abolition, as the only workable solution. Moreover, the very notion of reform bolsters the idea that the underlying institution is effectively just—merely suffering from managerial and operational inefficiencies. But I, along with countless immigrants, advocates, abolitionists, and all those fighting for collective liberation do not find “justice” in an immigration system that has deported or expelled [close to 600,000](https://unitedwedream.org/our-work/protect-immigrants-now/biden-stop-deportations-now/) in the first half of 2021 alone.\nThe establishment of an Article I immigration court system will do little other than legitimate the state’s heavy handed and oppressive approach to migration. Understandably, proponents of ‘independent’ immigration courts highlight that this approach would better guarantee fair and impartial decisions in immigration proceedings. But how much merit does judicial impartiality hold if the laws they apply are coercive to their core? Historically, conceptions of immigrants’ rights (like notions of racial equality) have fit conveniently into the formalist model of jurisprudence. So long as the rules are followed as prescribed by law, what is called “due process,” then a judge can pay lip service to an immigrant’s unfortunate personal circumstances while arriving at a decision that perpetuates the injustice and violence embodied by the law. An ‘independent’ immigration court would not solve the low rates of legal representation in immigration court, which is as low as 23% in North Carolina according to [TRAC](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/651/). This system would not change any of the inequities entrenched in the convoluted web of U.S. immigration law. And above all, this proposed solution would do nothing to help achieve the long-term goal of ending the prison-industrial complex in which immigration enforcement plays such a burgeoning role. It is hard to imagine that a “reformed” system would look much different from what we have now.\nAs is often the response to abolitionist perspectives, some will say we are overly focused on tearing systems down. But out of the mud the lotus will grow. A crucial part of the abolitionist vision is the desire to create and build new systems that transcend existing structural forms of oppression. Instead of searching for ways to improve the efficiency of an arm of the deportation machine, abolition challenges us to ask: “Why do we have a quasi-judicial body designed to rubber stamp the government’s unjust immigration practices in the first place?” From this principled standpoint, we can begin to experiment with new approaches to reduce the harm wrought by the U.S. immigration system and its racist, sexist, classist, and ableist legacies.\nFor anyone committed to collective liberation (in any form), this call for transformation is logical. Justice for immigrants, refugees, asylees, and all non-citizens living in what is known as the United States will not come from polishing a morally bankrupt immigration court system. Instead, we must ask, as abolitionists often do, “What can we imagine for ourselves and the world?” For me, answering this question (at least as it pertains to immigration) does not start with supporting a path of reform that would provide more money and resources to immigration courts. Rather, it begins with questioning the very existence of these “courts” and organizing with those people committed to transcending the structures of oppression they perpetuate."

    "title": "The Art of Never Being Satisfied",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Perfectionism is the enemy of productivity. Its principal feature is “the setting of excessively high personal standards of performance” (Frost et al. 1990, 450). This behavior is usually accompanied by overly critical assessments of one’s actions (Flett and Hewitt 2002). These two components form the conceptual core of perfectionism as well as underline a key part of what makes academic writing so challenging. After spending countless hours investigating a topic that we wish to do justice, it is hard not to feel the weight of the world on our shoulders when it is time to write.\nWe impose unreasonably high standards on our writing and feel as though we are failing expectations. For example, it is common to defer work on a literature review until we feel that we have a comprehensive grasp of extant research. This is an easy trap to fall into; we fool ourselves into believing that we can master some academic domain entirely on our own. The magnitude of this endeavor produces a mixture of pressure and isolation that squashes our drive to work as well as our ability to use time effectively. Now, having high standards for our writing is not bad in and of itself. The issue is that perfectionism creates needless obstacles to fruitful writing. Writing is an iterative process, like science and the acquisition of knowledge. Typically we cannot identify gaps in our understanding of a topic without first putting words to the page. This guide thus offers some advice on how to fight (and unlearn) perfectionism when writing."

    "section": "Identifying the problem",
    "text": "Identifying the problem\nThe most common symptoms of perfectionism in academia are chronically slow writing and obsessive editing. We write one, maybe two sentences and edit what we have ad infinitum. I often get trapped in this feedback loop the moment I sit down to write. I ask myself, “How can I express this idea in the best way humanly possible?” As I move from sentence to sentence, usually at an agonizingly slow pace, my excessively high standards pester me. I expect perfection from every thought that meets the page, fearing that if I do not clearly articulate my arguments right now, I never will. Almost always, this cycle of sluggish writing and compulsive editing leads to intense writer’s block. Burnout is right around the corner. How did writing become so excruciating? These cycles of self-critical behavior serve a purpose—to improve the quality of our writing. But there is a fine line between what the field of psychology calls the “adaptive” and “maladaptive” forms of perfectionism. The former is characterized by motivation and optimism, and the latter is associated with stress, anxiety, and even depression (Bieling, Israeli, and Antony 2004). It is not difficult to see why. As described above, I have spent an incalculable amount of time writing and rewriting single sentences, driven by a self-defeating anxiety that sacrifices long-term productivity. Instead, writing must be treated as an exercise in channeling the healthy features of perfectionism while discarding harmful habits. With this strategy, we can preserve high standards for our writing while avoiding persistent writer’s block and burnout.\nThe key is to separate writing from editing. In practice, however, taming perfectionism is not so easy. The “word vomit” approach is not particularly useful in the face of habitual pressure. But there lies a basic truth at the core of this method—vomiting is uncomfortable! In other words, whatever ends up on the page in an early draft probably will be messy and tough to clean up. But the disorder of this stage of the writing process is no less necessary than the final touches made to a high-quality product. To avoid obsessive editing, we must find ways to lower the stakes of writing drafts. The less time we waste on maladaptive behavior, the more time we have for productive writing now and intentional revisions later."

    "section": "When it is time to write…",
    "text": "When it is time to write…\n\nWrite routinely\nLowering the stakes of writing requires us to write routinely. Creative thoughts flow more freely when we reduce the pressure to create a perfect product on the first try. The commitment to write frequently and consistently is the “the art of applying ass to seat” or “the rear-to-chair principle,” as poet Dorothy Parker and political scientist Zachary Elkins, respectively, call it. Such advice may seem reductive. On the contrary, finding a “non-negotiable time to write” (Elkins 2017) is invaluable, especially for perfectionists who may otherwise demur.\nCreate a writing log, in which you commit to write for at least one hour every day, five days per week. This commitment to writing daily made possible the guide you are reading. The writing log functions as a space for exposure therapy. Exposure, generally speaking, involves a controlled approach toward the source of one’s fear through repeated contact, and is a cornerstone for treating anxiety disorders (Craske et al. 2014). A daily writing log can achieve the same kind of systematic desensitization. If the failure to achieve perfection impedes us from moving forward, it is only through repetition that we can rewire our brains to write more, and more quickly. Although the content of daily writing logs will vary widely, some general structural rules can maximize the utility of the exercise. It is best to delimit discrete log entries with a number, date, and shorthand title for the writing topic on a particular day. The entry number shows our progress; the date anchors our thoughts to some point in time; and the shorthand title serves as a location device if we wish to develop certain ideas further.1 The heading of a log entry may look something like this:\nLog 01: September 21, 2022\nTips and tricks for perfectionist writers…\nTogether, these three items constitute the organizational structure that connects otherwise distinct log entries. By tracking our progress, we can fight the nagging feeling that we are not meeting expectations. Moreover, using a reliable structure means we spend less time overthinking how to start writing. Instead, we settle into a mental groove for achieving high productivity. Over time, we start to see writing as an ordinary part of our professional routine. Expose yourself to regular writing in a measured manner, and you learn to replace anxiety with discipline.\n\n\nRecord your ideas informally\nPerfectionist writers often struggle with choosing a topic to write about, or articulating a specific idea. To sidestep writer’s block, we need a reservoir of ideas to draw from during times of scholarly drought. We can generate this supply by recording ideas using informal mediums. This strategy is meant to shield us from the cycle of myopic writing and neurotic editing that frequently depletes our mental faculties. Furthermore, low-stakes exercises in idea generation can help overcome the rigidity of perfectionist thinking that otherwise hinders our ability to reason and write creatively.\nFinding the best set of tools for recording our ideas requires experimentation. I have tested several techniques, including the following:\n\nThrowing spontaneous ideas into the notes application of my phone.\nRecording a voice memo explaining an idea to myself (or someone else).\nCreating a list of possible research projects in a free-form Google doc.\n\nThese three exercises are designed to stimulate the creativity that is needed for academic writing. They also share the same logic—that is, ideas that are not recorded somewhere will naturally fade away. Truth be told, we cannot predict those spontaneous moments of ingenuity that we covet as writers. Rather, we must equip ourselves with tools that allow us to capitalize on fleeting moments of original thought. Some of our ideas will be half-baked, but others may have the power to change the course of our intellectual development.\nMy own dissertation topic was born out of a messy Google doc. At the time, I was writing a co-authored paper on the public consultation organized in 2016 by the Chilean government to inform their constitution-making efforts. I started to investigate other countries’ experiences with national consultations in the process of constitutional design. I discovered that Cuba’s communist government organized local meetings in which 77.89% of the population discussed a draft of the 2019 constitution (Backer, Sapio, and Korman 2019). Why would an authoritarian regime assume the massive responsibility of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the voice of the citizenry? I recorded the question in my repository of ideas. Over the next few months, what could have been a passing thought blossomed into a seminar paper. This case study of Cuba has since become the departure point for my dissertation on public consultation in authoritarian constitution-making.\nRather than forcing myself to invent some spontaneous dissertation topic, I drew from the ideas that had accumulated in my Google doc. I dodged the trap of perfectionist writer’s block and instead stumbled upon a topic that has kept my interest. Some perfectionists may prefer other ways to record their ideas, but the lesson of the exercise is clear. Build a space where it is easy to translate creative energy into words, however messy they are. You can tap into this reservoir when your well of ideas (temporarily) runs dry."

    "section": "When it is time not to write",
    "text": "When it is time not to write\n\nBe kind to yourself\nA fundamental part of any writing strategy for perfectionists is knowing when not to write—that is, when to take a break. Perfectionists tend to have a much harder time unwinding and mentally separating themselves from work, which can damage their work-life balance and general well-being (Flaxman et al. 2012). Learning not to fixate on our work is crucial, as we cannot always achieve every one of our goals.2 Writing more, and more quickly, as a perfectionist is not instantaneous. It is an iterative process that requires us to get comfortable with steady progress and understand our limits. As we accept the Sisyphean nature of writing, we learn to appreciate that writing 1,000 words in a day is better than none at all (even if our goal was 2,000).\nThere will be days when we are tired, when we are distracted, when the last thing we want to do is write. Sometimes life gets in the way. But we must learn to trust our gut when it is time to step away from the laptop and stop ruminating about work. The alternative is that we let the frustration with not being able to write fester. We must be honest and accept that our tank is empty. Rest, reassess your goals, and start anew tomorrow. Learning your limits (slowly but surely) will make actually knowing when to write much easier.3\n\n\nSchedule breaks\nOne of the best ways to ensure that we take a break from writing, and from work generally, is to schedule rest times. We need to make downtime part of our routine in the same way we commit to writing daily. Structuring our writing schedule in this way is indispensable for avoiding burnout. If we do not establish reasonable work-life boundaries, we will only take breaks out of exhaustion. Writing grows only more and more difficult as we repeat this draining cycle. In order to develop sustainable writing habits, we must schedule daily and weekly rest times.\nI do not write after 10:00 PM; this is when I unwind at the end of the workday. I like to be in bed by 11:30 PM on weeknights, and if I do not have at least 90 minutes to separate from work completely, I typically have stress dreams about work. In these dreams, I am trapped in the same loop of indecision and anxiety that afflicts me on bad days. When I wake up, I find myself fatigued and less willing to return to work. Decompressing before bed instead allows me to detach, mentally and physically, from my writing space. I reflect on my strategy for the next day and put my daily writing goals in perspective. While 10:00 PM will not be the right time to disconnect for everyone, the logic stands—to break the cycle of stress and burnout, you must respect the sanctity of a good night’s sleep.\nI do not work on Saturdays. Taking off (at least) one day per week is even more important than relaxing at the end of the day. To be blunt, academic work culture is toxic, and perfectionists too often accept workaholism as the norm. Rather than treating academia like a job and taking real leisure time, we continue overworking and disregard fatigue as the cost of success. The principle of this strategy is similar to that behind the “no work after 10:00 PM” rule. We need space to breathe mentally in order to write effectively. We cannot get by with only intermittent breaks; we need (and deserve) a full day when we can disconnect and focus on other important things. Saturdays are best reserved for enjoyable, restorative activities such as spending time with friends and loved ones or having some “you” time. Without longer breaks, you heighten the risk of burnout and play into the workaholic culture of academia.\n\n\nCelebrate your wins\nMy final recommendation is simple—celebrate your wins, big and small. Good writing is not easy. Perfectionist ambitions make us blind to our own accomplishments. Rewarding yourself for hard work each step of the way is an essential part of unlearning harmful self-criticism and cultivating your confidence."

We must find healthy ways to achieve excellence without falling victim to our high standards. The strategies and ideas that I offer here are born out of personal experience. I have long struggled with perfectionist writing, and through self-reflection, I have tried to identify and change maladaptive behaviors. When it is time to write, we must write regularly using techniques that lower the stakes of writing. When it is time not to write, we must respect our limits, take breaks, and celebrate our wins. We can strive for excellence while also being kind to ourselves. Perfectionism is a tendency, not an immutable trait. We are capable of unlearning poor writing habits and replacing them with more constructive approaches. But we can only do so with practice. Now, I suggest you start writing."
