My name is Matthew Martin (he/him) and I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Government](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/gradstudents/mjm7865) at the University of Texas at Austin. My fields of study are public law and comparative politics. My substantive research interests include public participation in constitution-making, Latin American politics, indigenous constitutionalism, and immigration politics. I am on the 2025-26 job market.

My dissertation examines the use of public consultation in global constitution-making. I am constructing an [original data set](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PVTH3Z) of all such public consultations since 1974. I am also a senior research analyst at the [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/directors-staff/) working on related topics. We recently developed a [new method](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295396) for analyzing public consultation data using natural language processing (NLP) tools, and our research program continues to grow.

Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in Political Science and Legal Studies from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law at a firm in Washington, D.C. I assisted attorneys with family- and humanitarian-based immigration cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum. Today I continue to support trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers, gathering legal resources, contacting lawyers, and organizing fundraisers on their behalf.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and producing [music](https://soundcloud.com/mm-beats-wa)â€”mostly lofi hip-hop.
