My name is Matthew Martin (he/him), and I am completing my PhD in the [Department of Government](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/gradstudents/mjm7865) at the University of Texas at Austin in June 2025. I specialize in public law and comparative politics, with substantive research interests including Latin American politics, indigenous constitutionalism, and immigration politics. I am on the 2025-26 job market.

My dissertation "The People's Voice, The Drafters' Choice" examines the politics of public consultation in constitution-making. My methodological toolkit includes large-N analyses, natural language processing (NLP), elite interviews, and case studies. My first publication is accessible via open access at [*The Journal of Law and Courts*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-courts/article/elite-fractures-public-capture-the-strategic-use-of-public-consultation-in-global-constitutionmaking/A6BBCC7D2A7B5744D7766ABB4293595D). I am also a senior research analyst at the [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/directors-staff/) working on related [topics](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295396).

Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in Political Science and Legal Studies from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law at a firm in Washington, D.C. I assisted attorneys with family- and humanitarian-based immigration cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum. I continue to support trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers, gathering legal resources, contacting lawyers, and organizing fundraisers on their behalf.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and producing [music](https://soundcloud.com/mm-beats-wa)â€”mostly lofi hip-hop.
