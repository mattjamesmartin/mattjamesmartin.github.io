My name is Matt Martin (he/him), and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/). I recently completed my PhD in Government at the University of Texas at Austin, specializing in public law and comparative politics. My research examines constitution-making processes, with particular emphasis on mechanisms of public consultation. My other substantive interests include Latin American politics, U.S. immigration politics, and indigenous constitutionalism. In August 2026, I will start as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of South Carolina.

My dissertation analyzes how and why constitutional drafters consult citizens and incorporate public input, with comparative case studies of constitution-making in Chile and Cuba. My methodological toolkit includes large-N analyses, natural language processing of constitutional deliberations, elite interviews, and qualitative case studies. My first publication is accessible via open access at [*The Journal of Law and Courts*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-courts/article/elite-fractures-public-capture-the-strategic-use-of-public-consultation-in-global-constitutionmaking/A6BBCC7D2A7B5744D7766ABB4293595D)*.*

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law. I assisted attorneys with cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum, experience that motivates my scholarly interest in constitutional rights and immigration politics. I continue this commitment through mutual aid work supporting trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and producing [music](https://soundcloud.com/meridiem-beats)—mostly lofi hip-hop.
