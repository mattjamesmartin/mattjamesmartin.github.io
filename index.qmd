My name is Matthew Martin (he/him), and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Government](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/gradstudents/mjm7865) at the University of Texas at Austin. My fields of study are public law and comparative politics. My research interests include public participation in constitution-making, authoritarian constitutions, Latin American politics, and immigration law and politics. I am in the early stages of my dissertation, which examines the use of public consultation in constitution-making.

Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in Political Science and Legal Studies from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law at a firm in Washington, D.C. I assisted attorneys with family- and humanitarian- based immigration cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum. Today I continue to support trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers, gathering them legal resources, contacting lawyers, and organizing fundraisers to ensure their security.

My current research agenda focuses on public consultations in constitution-making. I am now constructing an original data set of all public consultations in constitution-making since 1789, which I plan to use for my dissertation and future research. I have also been involved in a project at the [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/directors-staff/) that develops an innovative method for analyzing public consultation records with natural language processing (NLP) tools.
