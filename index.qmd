My name is Matthew Martin (he/him), and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Government](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/gradstudents/mjm7865) at the University of Texas at Austin. My fields of study are public law and comparative politics. My research interests include public participation in constitution-making, authoritarian constitutions, indigenous constitutionalism, Latin American politics, and immigration law and politics. I am in the early stages of my dissertation, which examines the use of public consultation in constitution-making.

Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in Political Science and Legal Studies from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant in immigration law at a firm in Washington, D.C. I assisted attorneys with family- and humanitarian- based immigration cases ranging from permanent residence to removal defense to asylum. Today I continue to support trans and gender non-conforming asylum seekers, gathering legal resources, contacting lawyers, and organizing fundraisers to ensure their security.

My research agenda focuses on public consultations in constitution-making. I am constructing an original data set of all such public consultations since 1973, which I plan to use for my dissertation. I am also a Senior Research Analyst at the [Comparative Constitutions Project](https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/directors-staff/) working on related topics. We recently developed a [new method](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295396) for analyzing public consultation data using natural language processing (NLP) tools, and our research program continues to grow.
